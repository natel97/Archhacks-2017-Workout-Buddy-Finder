# Workout Partner Finder

ArchHacks 2017 Project

Winner of the **Best Social Hack by Facebook** award

## Purpose

We wanted to find a way to simplify finding workout partners based on different workouts. Workouts included:

- jogging
- walking
- bikeriding
- hiking
- yoga
- weight lifting

But could be expanded. We wanted to make it easier to try new workout types and meet new people and pair based on shared interests.

## Application Walkthrough

An Android Native application

### Login Page

Simple login system, matches against a local SQLite database for prototype sake.
